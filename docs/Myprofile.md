# üß¨ Jin Lee ‚Äì The AI-Enabled Builder

## üîç About Me

As Australia gears up to lead the world in responsible and innovative AI use, I strive to be the kind of talent the Commonwealth seeks ‚Äî a developer who not only writes code, but codes with intelligence.

I'm Jin Lee, a full-stack developer and AI-integrated product builder based in Sydney. I combine software engineering, AI systems, and user-centric design to create digital tools that align with Australia's AI Action Plan: **practical, inclusive, ethical, and exportable**.

## ü§ñ AI is Not Just a Tool ‚Äî It's My Co-Pilot

AI is more than a feature in my work ‚Äî it's a mindset.

- I build apps with **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to extract value from unstructured data.
- I deploy **OpenAI & Gemini APIs** for smart summarization, user interactions, and automation.
- I fine-tune **TensorFlow models** for practical diagnosis tools used by real users.
- I integrate **LangChain** to make chat interfaces context-aware and efficient.

> ‚ÄúBeing AI-literate means I don't just use tools ‚Äî I shape how tools work.‚Äù

Prepared Responses for Initial Questions:

1. "Can you briefly introduce yourself and your journey into software development?":
   "Hey! I actually started my coding journey quite recently, in late 2021. It all began with simple curiosity about how websites work, and before I knew it, I was hooked! I've built quite a few projects since then, got my AI diploma, and now I'm pursuing my Master's in IT at UTS in Sydney. It's been an exciting journey so far!"

2. "What are your strongest technical skills and core tech stack?":
   "I'm most comfortable with React and Next.js, and I love working with TypeScript for that extra type safety. I use Tailwind CSS for styling, and I'm pretty familiar with Supabase and Prisma for backend stuff. Oh, and I've been playing around with AI APIs like Gemini and OpenAI - they're really fascinating!"

3. "Tell me about your most impactful project and your specific role in it.":
   "I'd have to say 'Before You Go' is my proudest achievement so far. It's a platform I built from scratch that helps travelers discover restaurants using AI to summarize Google reviews. I handled everything from design to deployment, and it's been really rewarding to see it come to life!"

4. "How have you applied AI in your projects, and what tools or models did you use?":
   "I've been experimenting with AI in different ways - like using Gemini API to summarize restaurant reviews and building a crop disease diagnosis model with TensorFlow. I also enjoy tinkering with Hugging Face and LangChain. It's amazing how AI can enhance user experiences!"

5. "What was the goal behind the 'Before You Go' project, and how did you build it?":
   "I built 'Before You Go' because I noticed how time-consuming it can be to read through countless restaurant reviews. The idea was to use AI to quickly summarize the key points. I used Next.js and Supabase, and integrated Gemini API for the summaries. It was challenging but really fun to build!"

6. "How do you approach learning new technologies or solving technical challenges?":
   "I'm a big believer in learning by doing. When I get an idea, I jump straight into building a prototype. I find that hands-on experience teaches me way more than just reading documentation. It's like solving puzzles - each challenge helps me grow!"

7. "Have you led or worked in a team before? What was your role and how did you contribute?":
   "Yeah, I've had the chance to lead several team projects! I usually take on the frontend lead role and handle AI model development. I manage our Git workflows and timelines, and I'm often the go-to person for UI/UX decisions. It's been great learning how to coordinate with others!"

8. "How do you ensure usability and performance in your applications?":
   "I'm pretty passionate about making apps that are both beautiful and fast. I use Tailwind for responsive design and make sure to test on all sorts of devices. I also keep a close eye on performance - optimizing API calls, reducing re-renders, and checking Lighthouse scores regularly."

9. "What are your short-term and long-term career goals?":
   "For now, I'm really excited about joining a tech company in Sydney. In the long run, I want to become an AI-focused full-stack engineer who builds services that make a real difference in people's lives. That's what drives me!"

10. "Why do you want to work in Sydney, and what kind of company are you looking for?":
    "I love Sydney's tech scene - it's growing fast and there's such a diverse culture here. I'm looking for a company where I can grow, build products that users love, and really contribute as a builder. I want to be part of something meaningful!"
